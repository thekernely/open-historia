// the map exactly as it was, and the player had to hope some later event happened
// to narrate the same thing independently. That is issue #7's second defect, and
// it is why a rename that "completed" left the country called what it always was.

// Deliberately the SAME vocabulary as impacts.polityChanges / regionTransfers /
// regionClaims, normalized by the very same functions: it is applied through the
// same code path, ACTIONS_REFERENCE already documents the shapes, and the model
// therefore has nothing new to learn. The caps mirror the reasoning behind
// MAX_PROJECT_EVENT_IDS — this rides inside world.json, and a completion that
// rewrites eight polities or hands over forty regions is a model that has
// misunderstood the field rather than a campaign event.
//
// Returns null rather than an empty object when there is nothing, because ~95% of
