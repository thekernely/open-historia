// Splitting one long time skip into several shorter model calls, and putting the
// answers back together as the SINGLE round the player asked for.
//
// Why: a nine-month skip asks one request for 30-odd events, each carrying its
// own impacts — territory, units, markers, projects, diplomacy. That is tens of
// minutes of generation on a hosted provider, sent as one HTTP request with no
// bytes crossing the wire until it finishes, and a gateway closes it long before
// it does. The field report behind this was a 502 at exactly 301.7s on an
// endpoint that was answering every other task fine, which cost the player a turn
// with fourteen queued orders in it. A quarter-sized call finishes well inside
// any proxy window.
//
// The segments are a TRANSPORT detail and must never leak into the fiction. They
// are merged and applied once, so the round advances exactly once (see
// applySimulationResult), and the model is told explicitly that it is mid-round —
// otherwise segment two treats segment one's events as things the player saw and
// failed to answer, and punishes them for a silence they had no chance to break.
//
// Kept import-free and separate from gameplay.js (which pulls in the whole
// browser runtime and cannot be unit-tested) for the same reason as
// jsonSalvage.js, providerErrors.js and geminiSchema.js — the arithmetic and the
// merge rules are exactly what wants direct tests.
